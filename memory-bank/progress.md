## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **System Architecture Success:** The FastAPI + Next.js architecture has proven to be highly effective. The clear separation between backend API and frontend SPA allows for independent development and testing while maintaining clean integration patterns.

*   **Authentication Implementation:** Successfully transitioned from a design phase to a fully working JWT-based authentication system. The AuthContext pattern in React provides clean state management and the ProtectedRoute component ensures proper access control.

*   **Task Assignment Evolution:** Evolved from manual labeler ID input to automatic task assignment based on authenticated users. This greatly improved the user experience by eliminating confusing manual steps and streamlining the workflow.

*   **Error Resolution Methodology:** Developed effective debugging approaches for full-stack issues. The `currentLabelerId` error was resolved by tracing the complete data flow from browser console error back through React components to identify the specific prop passing issue.

*   **Real Data Integration Strategy:** Successfully replaced all placeholder data with real API integration. This revealed the importance of proper loading states and error handling that weren't apparent with mock data, leading to a more robust user experience.

*   **TypeScript Safety Implementation:** Added proper TypeScript interfaces throughout the application, particularly for reusable components. This helps catch errors at compile time and improves developer experience.

*   **Database Persistence Solution:** Successfully resolved by identifying and fixing the volume mount mismatch between `content_detector.db` (mounted) and `genai_labeling.db` (actual file used). This demonstrates the importance of verifying actual file paths vs configuration.

*   **API Key Integration Approach:** Chose to implement multiple storage methods for flexibility. The database storage method with authentication is working perfectly and provides the best user experience.

*   **Testing Strategy:** Successfully validated all backend functionality using curl commands before implementing frontend UI. This approach ensures that issues are isolated to the appropriate layer (frontend vs backend).

*   **Gemini AI SDK Migration:** Successfully migrated from the older `google-generativeai` package to the new `google-genai` package (v1.16.1), which required changing import patterns and API usage throughout the AI service.

*   **API Key Management Strategy:** Implemented multiple methods for API key storage to provide flexibility for different deployment scenarios and user preferences.

*   **Global Configuration System:** Implemented a shared YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) at the project root with corresponding utility modules in both backend (`config.py`) and frontend (`config.ts`) for consistent settings across the application.

*   **API Evolution Strategy:** Successfully evolved the backend API from returning HTML responses to returning JSON data for better SPA integration. This demonstrates how APIs can be adapted over time to better support frontend needs.

*   **Schema-First Development:** Added a dedicated Pydantic schema (`TaskResponse`) for the `/labeler/task` endpoint to provide a clear contract between frontend and backend.

*   **Form Data Submission:** For API endpoints that use FastAPI's `Form` parameters, the frontend must use `URLSearchParams` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type rather than JSON.

*   **Type Safety:** Created distinct interfaces for API data (`TaskDataFromAPI`) and component state (`Task`) to ensure type safety when working with backend data.

*   **Backend File Structure:** Core Python modules moved to `backend/src/` for better organization and alignment with `pyproject.toml` for Poetry.

*   **Docker Configuration:** `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/Dockerfile` (via `entrypoint.sh`) adapted to support the new `src/` layout, including correct `PYTHONPATH`, script execution, and volume mounts for database and templates.

*   **UI Design:** Using a dark theme with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

*   **Responsive Layout:** Frontend components use responsive design patterns (e.g., grid layouts with column spans for different viewport sizes).
