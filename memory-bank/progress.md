# Progress: GenAI Content Detection Assistant

## Current Status (as of last update)

**ðŸŽ¯ BACKEND FULLY FUNCTIONAL - FRONTEND AUTH IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED ðŸŽ¯**

The backend system is now fully operational with all major components working:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (Next.js with Tailwind CSS) - *Needs login implementation*
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI with SQLite) - **Fully functional**
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini AI integration working with real API keys - **Fully functional**
- **Database**: Persistence working correctly across container restarts - **Fully functional**

**Current Priority:** Implement frontend login screen and authentication state management.

### What Works / Implemented

    *   No more manual database initialization required.

*   **Authentication System (Backend Complete):**
    *   Login endpoint `/auth/login` fully functional.
    *   JWT token generation and validation working correctly.
    *   Admin user persisting: username "admin", password "admin123!".
    *   Token-based API access for all protected endpoints working.
    *   Logout endpoint `/auth/logout` implemented.

*   **API Key Management System (Backend Complete):**
    *   API key storage via `/ai/api-key` endpoint fully functional.

    *   API key status checking via `/ai/api-key/status` working.
    *   API key persistence across container restarts confirmed.
    *   Three storage methods all functional:
        1. Database storage via authenticated API endpoint âœ…
        2. Environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` âœ…
        3. Frontend UI (needs implementation)

*   **Gemini AI Integration (Complete & Working):**

*   **API Key Management System (Working):**
    *   Three methods for users to store their Gemini API keys:
        1. Through frontend UI via `/admin/api-key` endpoint (recommended)
        2. As environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` in docker-compose.yml  
        3. Directly via API endpoint using authentication token
    *   `/admin/validate-api-key` endpoint working correctly.
    *   Frontend components (`ApiKeyManager.tsx`, `ContentAnalyzer.tsx`) implemented.

*   **Docker Infrastructure (Stable):**
    *   Fixed frontend Dockerfile with proper multi-stage build for Next.js production deployment.
    *   Cleaned up docker-compose.yml by removing irrelevant openmemory/mem0 services.

    *   Both containers start successfully and are accessible.
    *   Backend logs show API endpoints are receiving requests and responding correctly.

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   Basic project structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
    *   `README.md` with project overview, setup instructions, and API endpoint documentation.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` updated for new backend structure, script and template volume mounts.
    *   Backend `Dockerfile` updated (implicitly, as `entrypoint.sh` was changed, and `PYTHONPATH` usage was confirmed).
    *   Frontend `Dockerfile` created (previous session).
    *   Global configuration file (`config.yaml`) created at project root.
*   **Backend (Restructured & API Adapted):**
    *   Core application modules (`main.py`, `models.py`, `database.py`, `schemas.py`) moved into `backend/src/`.
    *   Imports adjusted within these modules and in `scripts/init_db.py`.
    *   `backend/entrypoint.sh` updated for correct uvicorn execution path (`main:app` from `src`).
    *   Database initialization script (`scripts/init_db.py`) path and imports updated for Docker execution.
    *   FastAPI application structure within `backend/src/`.
    *   SQLite database (`content_detector.db`) path in `backend/src/database.py` configured for Docker volume mount (`/app/content_detector.db`).
    *   Jinja2 template path in `backend/src/main.py` configured for Docker volume mount (`/app/templates`).
    *   API endpoints (as defined in `backend/src/main.py`) for:
        *   Admin: User listing, URL upload form (GET), URL submission (POST).
        *   Labeler: Get task (GET) - now returns JSON instead of HTML, Submit label (POST) - now returns JSON response.
    *   Added new schema `TaskResponse` in `schemas.py` for JSON responses from `/labeler/task`.
    *   Added `ai_indicators_str` and `human_indicators_str` columns to `Label` model in `models.py`.
    *   Added corresponding fields to Label schemas in `schemas.py`.
    *   Added NumPy style docstrings to the updated endpoints.
    *   Created `backend/src/config.py` utility for loading and accessing the global configuration.
    *   Database schema updated with new columns by running `docker-compose exec backend poetry run python scripts/init_db.py`.
*   **Frontend (API Integration & Configuration Complete):**
    *   Basic Next.js application structure, root layout, home page, Navbar.
    *   **Admin URL Upload Feature (API Integration Complete):**
        *   `UrlUploadForm.tsx` now makes real API calls to `/admin/upload_urls` endpoint.
        *   Uses `API_BASE_URL` from environment variable with fallback to `http://localhost:8000`.
        *   Implements proper form data submission with `URLSearchParams`.
        *   Handles loading states and API response/errors.
    *   **Labeler Task Feature (API Integration Complete):**
        *   `TaskView.tsx` updated to fetch task data from `/labeler/task?user_id=${currentLabelerId}`.
        *   Now works with the JSON-returning backend endpoint.
        *   Handles loading, error states, and task data parsing.
        *   Passes task data and currentLabelerId to LabelingForm component.
        *   `LabelingForm.tsx` now fully integrated with backend API:
            *   Submits to `/labeler/submit_label` endpoint.
            *   Uses `URLSearchParams` for form data submission.
            *   Converts AI/Human indicators to comma-separated strings.
            *   Properly handles loading states and API responses.
            *   Uses the task start time from the API if available.
            *   Now uses AI and Human indicators from the global configuration.
    *   **Configuration System:**
        *   Created `frontend/src/lib/config.ts` utility module with TypeScript interfaces and functions for loading and accessing the global configuration.
        *   Added `js-yaml` and `@types/js-yaml` packages for parsing YAML in the frontend.
        *   Implemented proper TypeScript typing for configuration values.

### What's Left to Build / Next Steps

*   **Frontend Authentication Implementation (Current Priority):**
    *   Create login page/component with username and password fields.
    *   Implement JWT token storage and management (localStorage/sessionStorage).
    *   Add authentication state management throughout the Next.js application.
    *   Implement protected routes and authentication guards.
    *   Add proper login/logout user experience.

*   **Frontend API Key Management UI:**
    *   Create API key management component for admin interface.
    *   Integrate with backend `/ai/api-key` endpoints.
    *   Add API key validation feedback and status indicators.
    *   Implement user-friendly API key entry and testing.

*   **Frontend-Backend Integration Updates:**
    *   Update existing frontend components to use authentication.
    *   Modify all API calls to include JWT tokens in headers.
    *   Implement proper error handling for authentication failures (401/403).
    *   Test all existing workflows with authentication enabled.

*   **User Experience Enhancements:**
    *   Add proper navigation between admin and labeler interfaces.
    *   Implement role-based UI components and permissions.
    *   Add loading states and proper error messages throughout UI.

## Known Issues (as of last update)

*   **Frontend Missing Authentication:** The frontend currently has no login screen or authentication flow, making it impossible to access the backend APIs that require authentication.

*   **Frontend Components Not Integrated:** Existing frontend components (ApiKeyManager, ContentAnalyzer, etc.) exist but are not properly integrated with the authentication system or main application flow.

*   **BCrypt Version Warning:** There's a harmless warning about bcrypt version compatibility, but it doesn't prevent functionality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Database Persistence Solution:** Successfully resolved by identifying and fixing the volume mount mismatch between `content_detector.db` (mounted) and `genai_labeling.db` (actual file used). This demonstrates the importance of verifying actual file paths vs configuration.

*   **API Key Integration Approach:** Chose to implement multiple storage methods for flexibility. The database storage method with authentication is working perfectly and provides the best user experience.

*   **Frontend Authentication Strategy:** Need to implement a standard Next.js authentication pattern with JWT token management, protected routes, and proper state management across components.

*   **Testing Strategy:** Successfully validated all backend functionality using curl commands before implementing frontend UI. This approach ensures that issues are isolated to the appropriate layer (frontend vs backend).

*   **Gemini AI SDK Migration:** Successfully migrated from the older `google-generativeai` package to the new `google-genai` package (v1.16.1), which required changing import patterns and API usage throughout the AI service.

*   **API Key Management Strategy:** Implemented multiple methods for API key storage to provide flexibility for different deployment scenarios and user preferences.

*   **Global Configuration System:** Implemented a shared YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) at the project root with corresponding utility modules in both backend (`config.py`) and frontend (`config.ts`) for consistent settings across the application.

*   **API Evolution Strategy:** Successfully evolved the backend API from returning HTML responses to returning JSON data for better SPA integration. This demonstrates how APIs can be adapted over time to better support frontend needs.

*   **Schema-First Development:** Added a dedicated Pydantic schema (`TaskResponse`) for the `/labeler/task` endpoint to provide a clear contract between frontend and backend.

*   **Form Data Submission:** For API endpoints that use FastAPI's `Form` parameters, the frontend must use `URLSearchParams` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type rather than JSON.

*   **Type Safety:** Created distinct interfaces for API data (`TaskDataFromAPI`) and component state (`Task`) to ensure type safety when working with backend data.

*   **Backend File Structure:** Core Python modules moved to `backend/src/` for better organization and alignment with `pyproject.toml` for Poetry.

*   **Docker Configuration:** `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/Dockerfile` (via `entrypoint.sh`) adapted to support the new `src/` layout, including correct `PYTHONPATH`, script execution, and volume mounts for database and templates.

*   **UI Design:** Using a dark theme with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

*   **Responsive Layout:** Frontend components use responsive design patterns (e.g., grid layouts with column spans for different viewport sizes).
