        *   For "no tasks available" scenarios, returns JSON with `message_title` and `message_body` instead of HTML.
    *   Modified `backend/src/main.py`'s `submit_label` endpoint to return JSON responses instead of HTML templates.
    *   Added support for storing AI and human indicators:
        *   Added `ai_indicators_str` and `human_indicators_str` columns to the `Label` model in `models.py`.
        *   Added corresponding fields to the Label schemas in `schemas.py`.
        *   Updated the `submit_label` endpoint to accept and store these values from form data.
    *   Added NumPy style docstrings to the updated endpoints.

*   **Frontend - API Integration (Complete):**
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/admin/UrlUploadForm.tsx` to make real API calls to `${API_BASE_URL}/admin/upload_urls` endpoint:
        *   Set up `API_BASE_URL` using environment variable with fallback to `http://localhost:8000`.
        *   Implemented form data submission using `URLSearchParams` with appropriate Content-Type.
        *   Added loading states to improve UX during API calls.
        *   Added error handling for API responses.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/TaskView.tsx` to fetch task data from the backend API:
        *   Designed to call `${API_BASE_URL}/labeler/task?user_id=${currentLabelerId}`.
        *   Created more robust interfaces for API data (`TaskDataFromAPI`) and component state (`Task`).
        *   Implemented proper loading and error states.
        *   Now works with the updated JSON-returning backend endpoint.
        *   Added a `currentLabelerId` prop passed to `LabelingForm` component.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/LabelingForm.tsx` to submit to the backend API:
        *   Implemented integration with `${API_BASE_URL}/labeler/submit_label` endpoint.
        *   Updated form submission to use `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.
        *   Converted selected AI and Human indicators to comma-separated strings.
        *   Added proper error handling and loading states during submission.
        *   Used the `currentLabelerId` prop from `TaskView` for the user ID.
        *   Handles task start time correctly whether provided by API or tracked locally.

*   **Backend Restructuring (Previous Task):**
    *   Moved core Python modules (`main.py`, `models.py`, `database.py`, `schemas.py`) from `backend/` root into `backend/src/`.
    *   The `backend/src/app_code/` directory (and its residual contents) was removed as the modules are now directly in `backend/src/`.
    *   Adjusted Python import statements in the moved files to reflect their new sibling status within `backend/src/` (e.g., `from database import Base` in `models.py`).
    *   Updated `backend/entrypoint.sh` to correctly call `
