        - Implemented category metadata with icons and color themes
        - Added comprehensive filtering and search functionality
    *   **Benefits**: Much more intuitive and pleasant to work with large numbers of indicators

*   **Critical Labeling Screen Bug Fix (Latest):**
    *   Fixed `currentLabelerId is not defined` JavaScript error that was preventing the labeling screen from loading.
    *   Root cause: When updating TaskView to use authenticated users, the `currentLabelerId` state variable was removed but the LabelingForm component call still referenced it.
    *   Solution: Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/TaskView.tsx` to pass `task.userId` instead of undefined `currentLabelerId`.
    *   Labeling screen now loads correctly and allows labelers to work on tasks.

*   **Authentication System Working (Latest):**
    *   Complete authentication flow implemented and tested:
        - Login page with username/password form
        - JWT token storage in localStorage
        - AuthContext for global authentication state
        - ProtectedRoute component for role-based access control
        - Automatic token refresh and logout functionality
    *   Fixed import path issues that were causing "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" errors.
    *   Updated API calls throughout the application to include proper authentication headers.

*   **Task Assignment System Working (Latest):**
    *   Backend `/labeler/task` endpoint updated to use authenticated user instead of manual labeler ID input.
    *   Auto-assignment logic working: tasks are assigned to authenticated labelers when they request them.
    *   Task status properly updated from PENDING ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED.
    *   Labelers can successfully fetch, view, and submit labels for assigned tasks.

*   **Admin URL Upload System Working (Latest):**
    *   Admin upload interface fully functional with real API integration.
    *   Bulk URL upload with form data submission working correctly.
    *   Option to reset existing URLs to PENDING status implemented.
    *   Real-time feedback and error handling for upload operations.
    *   Statistics and upload history displaying real data from backend APIs.

*   **Dashboard Statistics Integration (Latest):**
    *   Replaced all placeholder statistics with real API calls to `/dashboard` endpoint.
    *   Created `DashboardStats` component that fetches actual user and system statistics.
    *   Implemented `UploadHistory` component for displaying real content upload history.
    *   Added proper loading states and error handling for dashboard data.
    *   Role-based statistics display (admin sees system stats, labelers see personal stats).

*   **Real API Integration Complete (Latest):**
    *   All frontend components now use real backend APIs instead of mock data.
    *   Removed hardcoded statistics, placeholder content, and simulated API calls.
    *   Proper error handling and loading states implemented across all components.
    *   Authentication headers properly included in all API requests.

*   **TypeScript Icon Component Fixes (Latest):**
    *   Fixed linter errors in admin upload page by adding proper TypeScript interfaces to icon components.
    *   Updated `CheckIcon` and `AlertIcon` components to accept optional `className` props.
    *   Improved type safety throughout the UI components.

*   **Database Persistence Issue RESOLVED (Latest):**
    *   Fixed critical volume mount mismatch between `content_detector.db` and `genai_labeling.db`.
    *   Updated docker-compose.yml to mount the correct database file (`./genai_labeling.db:/app/genai_labeling.db`).
    *   Database now properly persists between container restarts.
    *   Admin user and API keys now survive container restarts.

*   **API Key Integration FULLY WORKING (Latest):**
    *   Successfully tested API key storage via `/ai/api-key` endpoint with authentication.
    *   API key validation with real Gemini keys working correctly.
    *   API key persistence across container restarts confirmed.
    *   Three storage methods available and functional:
        1. Via authenticated API endpoint (tested and working)
        2. Environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` 
        3. Frontend UI (needs implementation)

*   **Authentication System WORKING:**
    *   Login endpoint `/auth/login` working correctly.
    *   JWT token generation and validation functional.
    *   Admin user (username: "admin", password: "admin123!") created and persisting.
    *   Token-based API access for protected endpoints working.

*   **Gemini AI Service Integration (Complete):**

    *   Database initialization script (`scripts/init_db.py`) works but needs to be run manually after container startup.
    *   BCrypt version warnings present but not blocking functionality.
    *   Successfully initialized database with admin user (username: "admin", password: "admin123!").

*   **API Key Storage Options Clarified:**
    *   Users can store their Gemini API key in three ways:
        1. Through the frontend UI via `/admin/api-key` endpoint (recommended)
        2. As environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` in docker-compose.yml
        3. Directly via API endpoint using authentication token
    *   API key validation endpoint `/admin/validate-api-key` working correctly.

*   **Docker Network Communication Fix (Latest):**
    *   Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://backend:8000` environment variable to frontend service in docker-compose.yml.
    *   Configured proper Docker service name communication for internal API calls.
    *   Verified that existing frontend code already uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` correctly.
    *   No code changes were required - the environment variable approach was already implemented.
    *   System now uses Docker service names for internal communication while maintaining external accessibility.
    *   Deployment-ready configuration that can be easily adapted for different environments.

    *   Added keyboard shortcuts (Enter key) for better user experience
    *   Implemented proper iframe error handling for website content loading
    *   Added visual indicators when config-loaded indicators are being used vs defaults

*   **Database Schema Update (Complete):**
    *   Successfully ran `docker-compose exec backend poetry run python scripts/init_db.py` to update the database schema with the new columns (`ai_indicators_str` and `human_indicators_str`).
    *   Discovered that the backend container requires using Poetry to run Python scripts (`poetry run python ...`) to ensure all dependencies are available.

*   **Frontend Component Updates (Complete):**
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/LabelingForm.tsx` to use AI and Human indicators from the global configuration instead of hardcoded lists.
    *   Added proper TypeScript typing for the indicator items.

*   **Global Configuration System (Complete):**
    *   Created a shared `config.yaml` file at the project root with settings for both frontend and backend.
    *   Implemented `backend/src/config.py` with `get_config()` and `get_config_value()` functions to load and access configuration in Python.
    *   Implemented `frontend/src/lib/config.ts` with TypeScript interfaces and utility functions (`loadConfig()`, `getConfigValue()`, `getApiUrl()`) for the frontend.
    *   Added AI and Human indicators to the configuration.
    *   Installed `js-yaml` and `@types/js-yaml` packages for the frontend to parse YAML.

*   **Backend API Adaptation (Complete):**
    *   Modified `backend/src/main.py`'s `get_labeler_task` endpoint to return JSON data instead of HTML:
        *   Created a new `TaskResponse` Pydantic schema in `schemas.py` to define the response structure.
        *   Updated the endpoint to use `response_model=TaskResponse` for automatic validation and serialization.
        *   Changed the endpoint to return JSON with `website_id`, `website_url`, `user_id`, and `task_start_time` for tasks.
        *   For "no tasks available" scenarios, returns JSON with `message_title` and `message_body` instead of HTML.
    *   Modified `backend/src/main.py`'s `submit_label` endpoint to return JSON responses instead of HTML templates.
    *   Added support for storing AI and human indicators:
        *   Added `ai_indicators_str` and `human_indicators_str` columns to the `Label` model in `models.py`.
        *   Added corresponding fields to the Label schemas in `schemas.py`.
        *   Updated the `submit_label` endpoint to accept and store these values from form data.
    *   Added NumPy style docstrings to the updated endpoints.

*   **Frontend - API Integration (Complete):**
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/admin/UrlUploadForm.tsx` to make real API calls to `${API_BASE_URL}/admin/upload_urls` endpoint:
        *   Set up `API_BASE_URL` using environment variable with fallback to `http://localhost:8000`.
        *   Implemented form data submission using `URLSearchParams` with appropriate Content-Type.
        *   Added loading states to improve UX during API calls.
        *   Added error handling for API responses.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/TaskView.tsx` to fetch task data from the backend API:
        *   Designed to call `${API_BASE_URL}/labeler/task?user_id=${currentLabelerId}`.
        *   Created more robust interfaces for API data (`TaskDataFromAPI`) and component state (`Task`).
        *   Implemented proper loading and error states.
        *   Now works with the updated JSON-returning backend endpoint.
        *   Added a `currentLabelerId` prop passed to `LabelingForm` component.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/components/labeler/LabelingForm.tsx` to submit to the backend API:
        *   Implemented integration with `${API_BASE_URL}/labeler/submit_label` endpoint.
        *   Updated form submission to use `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.
        *   Converted selected AI and Human indicators to comma-separated strings.
        *   Added proper error handling and loading states during submission.
        *   Used the `currentLabelerId` prop from `TaskView` for the user ID.
        *   Handles task start time correctly whether provided by API or tracked locally.

*   **Backend Restructuring (Previous Task):**
    *   Moved core Python modules (`main.py`, `models.py`, `database.py`, `schemas.py`) from `backend/` root into `backend/src/`.
    *   The `backend/src/app_code/` directory (and its residual contents) was removed as the modules are now directly in `backend/src/`.
    *   Adjusted Python import statements in the moved files to reflect their new sibling status within `backend/src/` (e.g., `from database import Base` in `models.py`).
    *   Updated `backend/entrypoint.sh` to correctly call `

## 3. Next Steps

*   **Dashboard Enhancement Opportunities (Current Priority):**
    *   Test the new comprehensive dashboard with real data
    *   Implement export functionality for URL lists and statistics

    *   **User Management**: Enhanced user creation and role management from dashboard

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **UI Design Philosophy Success:** The new tag-based interface with collapsible sections has dramatically improved usability. Users can now efficiently work with 50+ indicators without feeling overwhelmed.

*   **Component Architecture:** The modular approach with `IndicatorTag` and `CategorySection` components makes the interface maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.

*   **Search and Filter Strategy:** Real-time search combined with category organization and show-selected filtering provides multiple ways for users to efficiently navigate large indicator lists.

*   **Visual Design Patterns:** Using color themes (red for AI, green for Human) and meaningful category icons creates clear visual associations that help users understand the interface intuitively.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences (from User Instructions)

*   **NumPy Style Docstrings (Python):** Required for all Python code.
*   **Global Configuration File (YAML/JSON):** For shared settings between backend and frontend.
*   **Backend: Python with FastAPI.**
*   **Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS.**
*   **Dependency Management (Backend): Poetry via terminal.**
*   **Code Search:** Check codebase/online for existing solutions before creating new modules.
*   **Memory Bank Usage:** Must read all memory bank files at the start of every task and update them when significant changes occur or when requested.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

*   **UI/UX Design Impact:** The difference between a functional interface and a great interface is enormous. The new indicator design transforms the user experience from tedious to enjoyable.

*   **Component Design Patterns:** Breaking complex UI into smaller, focused components (`IndicatorTag`, `CategorySection`) makes the code more maintainable and enables better reusability.

*   **State Management for Complex UI:** Managing multiple interactive states (search, expansion, selection, filtering) requires careful planning but enables powerful user interactions.

*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Using icons, colors, and spacing effectively creates intuitive navigation even with large amounts of information.
